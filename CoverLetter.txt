I am passionate about building things that matter. Open source and the maker movement inspires me. Continuous learning is something I strive for.

I also harbor a strong desire to facilitate effective work processes. Building without waste, and with high quality, is important to me. As a software developer, I've found practices such as pair programming and test driven development to be highly effective. 

I've always had deep interest in space travel and exploration. That interest fueled my enthusiasm during my time at university, and lead to my choice of graduate study in aeronautics and astronautics engineering. In my graduate work I spent three years as a research assistant on a magnetically confined plasma fusion experiment. 

My software development hobby led me to the software industry; since 2007 I have been with Microsoft. I have worked on projects that include: the Xbox 360, Xbox One, and Microsoft online store.  

I would be thrilled to find a career which combines my enthusiasm and aptitude for software development with my passion for space technologies.
